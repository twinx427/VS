## Overview
Office Email Validator is a Go-based application designed to validate email addresses, specifically for Microsoft Office email services. It leverages multithreading for high performance and utilizes HTTP requests to verify email authenticity.

The project demonstrates robust error handling, efficient worker management, and sleek CLI presentation, making it an excellent tool for anyone working with email validation at scale.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded processing**: Efficiently processes up to 250 workers for large-scale email validations.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes Microsoft’s API endpoint for email validation.
- **Console Styling**: Clear and visually appealing CLI output with colors and formatting.
- **Blacklist Filtering**: Filters out blacklisted domains.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles network issues and retry logic for seamless processing.

---

## How It Works

1. The program reads an input file containing email addresses.
2. Blacklisted email domains are filtered out during preprocessing.
3. Each email is validated using a POST request to the Microsoft validation endpoint.
4. Results are displayed in the CLI and saved to an output file.
